this is guide for VCO - based ADC design by ToiNguyenDinh supporter DucManhTran and HieuBuiDuy with:
- Ipunt signal (sine and bpsk wave)
- Voltage - Controlled Oscillator
- Phase - Readout
- Decimation Filter

folde 		|	status

		|		+ VCO:
		|			* Frequency
		|			* phase
		|		* Phase - Readout
		|		* Decimation Filter
		|		* FFT

				* components that make up the systems
			tb (test bench)
				* simulation system (with bpsk and without bpsk)			
verilog			calculate Sinc Filter

python			convert data (plus 5 phases of RO)
